      <div class="mt-3">
        An encrypted backup of certain information associated with your wallet can be stored on eligible devices. The wallet address is linked to the
        private key; together, they permit the authorization of the transfer of Digital Assets from and into that wallet address. You bear exclusive
        responsibility for the preservation and security of your private key and any mnemonic phrase ("Secret Phrase") related to your wallet.
      </div>
      <div>
        It is imperative to safeguard access information for your wallet address, secret phrase, and private key. Equally crucial is the backup of
        your private keys, backup phrases, or passwords. Failing to do so may conclude in losing authority over Digital Assets tied to your wallet.
        Please note that we do not gain or retain your wallet password, encrypted private key, unencrypted private key, or secret phrase connected to
        your wallet. Furthermore, we cannot produce a replacement password for your wallet if you forgot your primary password.
      </div>
      <div>
        In case you have not securely preserved a backup of any private key and wallet address pair existing in your wallet, remember that all Digital
        Assets associated with such a wallet address will be unreachable. Hence, we expressly disclaim any responsibility or liability in the event
        you are unable to access your wallet for any reason, including but not confined to your failure to secure your wallet address, Secret Phrase,
        and private key information.
      </div>
      <div>
        Protecting your Digital Assets requires your full caution and alertness. Trust Wallet operations are premised on the principle that you're
        fully aware of the importance of your Digital Assets and will execute necessary steps to safeguard them. You agree to be solely responsible
        for any actions you perform within Trust Wallet and acknowledge the risks associated with digital asset management.

      <h4 class="font-bold">Use of DApps and DEX</h4>
      <div class="mt-3">
        When accessing or using decentralized applications (DApps) or decentralized exchanges (DEX), including but not limited to the DApp
        functionality within our Services such as the "Trade/Swap Digital Assets" feature, you are required to understand and agree to the following
        terms:
      </div>
      <div>
        - Trust Wallet does not control, endorse, or take responsibility for your engagement with or use of DApps or DEX. Trust Wallet has no
        liability or obligation related to your use of DApps or DEX, including but not limited to any transactions that are disputed or result in
        losses.
      </div>
      <div>
        - The amount that you can trade through DEX each day is subject to the rules and limitations set by the third-party developers of the Smart
        Contracts. Trust Wallet does not control these limits and is not responsible for enforcing them.
      </div>
      <div>
        - All transactions on the blockchain are final and cannot be reversed. This means that any transaction made via DApps or DEX is entirely under
        your control and responsibility. You take full responsibility for the outcomes of any issues related to these transactions, including but not
        limited to transfers to incorrect addresses or problems with the node servers you have selected.
      </div>
      <div>
        - Using DApps or DEX may result in handling or service fees associated with the third-party Smart Contracts. These fees are determined by the
        third-party developers and are not controlled by Trust Wallet. Users should review the fee information provided by the third-party service
        providers before engaging in any transactions. Any information displayed on Trust Wallet about these fees is for reference purposes only.
        Trust Wallet cannot guarantee the accuracy, relevance, reliability, integrity, or suitability of this information and will not be liable for
        any losses or damages, direct or indirect, arising from your use of this information.
      </div>
      <div>
        - Trust Wallet reserves the right to introduce charges in the future at its discretion. Any fee updates will apply to transactions conducted
        after the updated fees come into effect. Users will be notified of such changes through reasonable means, including updates on our website or
        mobile application.
      </div>
      <div>
        By using DApps and DEX via Trust Wallet, you acknowledge and accept these associated risks and potential fees. Trust Wallet strives to create
        a user-friendly environment that rigorously adheres to legal standards and regulations. By agreeing to these terms, you strengthen our
        commitment to security, transparency, and user empowerment.

      <h4 class="font-bold">Use of Staking Service</h4>
      <div class="mt-3">
        Use of Staking Service
        <br />
        When you access or utilize the Staking Service, you will work with a third-party provider that stakes specific Digital Assets ("Staked Digital
        Assets") for validating transactions on the related blockchain network. Successful validations may yield a network-issued reward ("Staking
        Reward"). In using the Staking Service, you acknowledge and agree to the following:
        <br />
        - Trust Wallet does not control or take liability for your use of the Staking Service. We expressly disclaim all liability for any potential
        issues or losses related to your use of the Staking Service, including any loss of Staked Digital Assets, failure to obtain Staking Rewards,
        or fees incurred during the process.
        <br />
        - Trust Wallet cannot guarantee uninterrupted Staking operations. Interruptions in service can occur due to many factors beyond our control,
        such as codebase updates, network protocol changes, actions from third-party providers, or network congestion.
        <br />
        - Trust Wallet cannot ensure the staking or ongoing staking of any specific Digital Asset. The feasibility of staking certain Digital Assets
        is based on the respective blockchain networks rules and the third-party staking service provider's terms and conditions.
        <br />
        - Trust Wallet bears no control over or responsibility for the Staking Rewards provided by the relevant blockchain network. Decisions about
        the distribution of Staking Rewards, including frequency and amount, solely rest with the respective networks and not Trust Wallet.
        <br />
        - Trust Wallet does not provide advice or make any predictions about the potential value or suitability of any specific Digital Asset or the
        Staking Service. Any decision to use the Staking Service is your own, and Trust Wallet assumes no responsibility for this.
        <br />
        - Trust Wallet will never take custody of any of your rewards or assets and has no control over any Proof-of-Stake network where Trust Wallet
        may exercise validation rights delegated by you.
        <br />
        - Trust Wallet does not guarantee that you will receive Staking Rewards or any specific Staking Reward rates. The successful transfer of the
        rewards is subject to the Proof-of-Stake networks and is not under Trust Wallet's control.
        <br />
        - Staking services are provided "as is." Trust Wallet is not responsible for any failure by any supported Proof-of-Stake (POS) network to
        transfer rewards or for the loss of rewards due to reasons such as transfer to an incorrect wallet address or other risks like "slashing" (a
        penalty imposed by the network for malicious behavior or failure to validate transactions).
        <br />
        - Trust Wallet does not guarantee uninterrupted or error-free operation of the staking services, nor does it ensure that it will rectify all
        defects or prevent disruptions caused by third parties or unauthorized third-party access.
        <br />
        By choosing to use the Staking Service, you acknowledge these conditions and understand the inherent risks. Before staking, conduct thorough
        research and careful analysis to ensure alignment with your financial goals and risk tolerance, and to understand the staking process. While
        Trust Wallet aims for transparency and to safeguard user interests, your agreement to these terms underpins personal responsibility for
        staking choices.
        <br />
        We reserve the right to modify this section at any time without prior notice. It is your responsibility to regularly check this section for
        any amendments. Your continued use of the Staking Service signifies your acceptance of these terms and any amendments thereof.

      <h4 class="font-bold">Buy Digital Assets with Supported Credit or Debit Cards</h4>
      <div class="mt-3">
        If you opt to use Trust Wallet to purchase Digital Assets with your credit or debit card, the chosen amount will be converted into the
        applicable Digital Asset and credited to your wallet by a third-party entity. As you do so, it's important to acknowledge and agree that:
        <br />
        (i) Trust Wallet is not liable for, nor does it hold any responsibility related to, your usage of this third-party service. It can't be held
        accountable for any losses incurred during this process;
        <br />
        (ii) When using this service, you are bound by any terms and conditions set forth by the specific third-party service provider. Trust Wallet

        (iii) Once your request has been submitted, Trust Wallet doesn't have the power or authority to revise, rescind, or cancel any conversion
        requests. The transaction is entirely out of Trust Wallet's hands;
        <br />
        (iv) Trust Wallet is not responsible or liable in any way for the exchange rates offered by the involved third-party service provider. This
        includes any fluctuation in rate that may occur post-transaction;
        <br />
        (v) Trust Wallet doesn't shoulder responsibility for any fees imposed by the relevant third-party service provider or your bank or credit card
        issuer. Any additional charges incurred during the transaction process rest solely on your account.
        <br />
        By choosing to buy Digital Assets via Trust Wallet, you acknowledge these terms and consent to bear any risks associated with this type of

        (i) Trust Wallet is not equipped to cancel or modify your transaction;

        (ii) Blockchain networks might delay or fail to complete the transaction details you've submitted;
        <br />
        (iii) Trust Wallet does not store, transmit, or receive Digital Assets. All related actions occur wholly within the framework of the
        applicable blockchain protocol;
        <br />
        (iv) Any transfer that relates to any Digital Asset is processed on the applicable blockchain network and not on a network owned or operated
        by Trust Wallet, and therefore, Trust Wallet cannot guarantee the transfer of title or rights in any Digital Asset.
        <br />
        By employing Trust Wallet's services, you accept all inherent risks associated with the transaction process and the volatile nature of Digital
        Assets.

        Services following such updates indicates your acceptance of these changes. We recommend that users regularly check our website and mobile app
        to stay informed about the currently applicable fees.
        <br />
        Upon posting online, any new fee information comes into effect immediately unless stated otherwise. It remains your responsibility to stay
        informed about the current fee structure.
        <br />
        Moreover, it's essential to understand that third-party services, including blockchain networks, could add additional transaction processing
        fees. These added charges fall outside our jurisdiction and influence. Hence, we disavow any responsibility for fees associated with
        third-party services.

      <h4 class="font-bold">Transaction Fees</h4>
      <div class="mt-3">
        Your virtual currency transactions may incur transaction fees, such as mining fees, which are mandated by the virtual currency system or
        blockchain network you choose to use. Before initiating a transaction, it is your responsibility to ensure that your wallet has a sufficient
        balance and/or "gas" (network processing power) to complete the transaction fully.
        <br />
        It is crucial to note that we hold no control or influence over these fees or the fee setting mechanisms of third-party systems. Consequently,
        we are not liable for any transaction failures or financial losses you may experience due to inappropriately entered transaction fees (for
        instance, fees that are set too low or too high). This also extends to any issues arising from insufficient funds or gas associated with your
        wallet address.
        <br />
        For the sake of clarity, we do not have access to your or anyone else's transactions due to the non-custodial premises of our Services. We
        manage no transactions nor retain any private keys associated with any wallets.

        appropriate tax authority.
        <br />
        We expressly clarify that our role does not include determining if taxes apply to your transactions. We are not in the business of collecting,
        reporting, withholding, or remitting any taxes arising from any Digital Asset-related transactions. Thus any tax obligations that accrue from
        your transactions through our Services is a matter for you and the applicable tax authorities.

        <br />
        Excluding scenarios where Applicable Law stipulates or offers an alternative, these Terms, inclusive of the arbitration agreement herein, are
        to be governed by, and interpreted in line with, the laws of Hong Kong.
        <br />
        (ii) Class Action Waiver
        <br />
        Except in instances where Applicable Law necessitates or offers an alternate choice, you and Trust Wallet agree that, subject to the clause
        regarding Notice of Claim and Dispute Resolution Period mentioned above, any Claim must be resolved by compulsory, final, and binding
        individual (not class) arbitration overseen by the Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre ("HKIAC") and in accordance with its prevailing
        Rules, which are deemed incorporated by reference into this clause.
        <br />
        You and Trust Wallet affirm that any Claims will be raised against Trust Wallet through arbitration on an individual basis only, and not as a
        plaintiff or class member in a proposed class or representative action. You also commit to foregoing any rights for such Claims to be brought,
        heard, or arbitrated as a class, collective, representative, or private attorney general action, as far as applicable law permits. Joining or
        consolidating individual arbitrations into a single arbitration is not permissible without Trust Wallet's express consent.
        <br />
        (iii) Agreement to Arbitrate
        <br />
        Except in instances where Applicable Law necessitates or offers an alternate choice, you and Trust Wallet agree that, subject to the clause
        regarding Notice of Claim and Dispute Resolution Period mentioned above, any Claim must be resolved by compulsory, final, and binding
        individual (not class) arbitration overseen by the Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre ("HKIAC") and in accordance with its prevailing
        Rules, which are deemed incorporated by reference into this clause.
        <br />
        The seat of arbitration is agreed to be Hong Kong. The Tribunal will consist of one (1) arbitrator to be appointed as per the HKIAC Rules. The
        language for the arbitration will be English. You and Trust Wallet further concur that the arbitrator will solely hold the power to rule on
        his or her jurisdiction, which includes any objections pertaining to the existence, scope, or validity of the Agreement to Arbitrate, or to
        the arbitrability of any Claim. The arbitration provisions detailed in this clause will survive the termination of these Terms.
        <br />
        Limitation period for filing: To raise any arbitration against Trust Wallet, a Notice of Arbitration must be filed and served in accordance
        with the HKIAC Rules within one (1) year from the date the user asserting the Claim first identified, or should have reasonably found out, the
        alleged act, omission, or default leading to the Claim ("Limitation Period").
        <br />
        This includes the Dispute Resolution Period as mentioned in clause 31.1. If the Notice of Arbitration in respect of a Claim is not filed and
        served on Trust Wallet within that Limitation Period, there will be no recourse or relief for any Claim by the user. If the Limitation Period
        contradicts applicable law, the user is obliged to bring any Claim against Trust Wallet within the shortest time period permitted by the
        applicable law. Trust Wallet can be served the Notice of Arbitration in accordance with the Applicable Laws and service rules.
        <br />
        Notice: If Trust Wallet commences arbitration against you, it will provide notice at the email address or postal address you have provided.
        You agree that any notice sent to this email or postal address will be considered sufficient for all purposes, including determinations
        relating to the adequacy of service. It is your obligation to keep the email address and/or postal address on file with Trust Wallet
